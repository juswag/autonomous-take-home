Grid helpers — pure Python, NO ROS in this file.

Keeping the grid maths free of ROS is deliberate: it means you can test it with
a plain `python -m unittest` without starting the simulator. Run the tests as you go:

    python -m unittest tests.test_grid_utils -v

    Return a NEW grid in which every cell within `radius_m` metres of an OCCUPIED
    cell is also marked OCCUPIED. (Don't modify the grid you were given.)

    Why: the planner treats the rover as a single point, but the real rover is a
    disc of radius `robot_radius_m`. A path that runs along the very edge of an
    obstacle is fine for a point and impossible for a disc. Growing every obstacle
    by the rover's radius lets you keep planning for a point.

    Notes:
      * radius_m is in METRES, cells are `grid.resolution` metres — convert.
      * Obstacles near the edge of the grid must not cause an IndexError.
      * Cells that are UNKNOWN or FREE may become OCCUPIED; OCCUPIED never becomes FREE.
      * Distance can be measured between cell centres. Whether you use a square or
        a circular neighbourhood is up to you — the tests accept either as long as
        the cells directly next to an obstacle (up/down/left/right) are covered
        for radius >= one cell.
